# BirdClassification
CNN model for bird image recognition

This project is a work in progress. 
I have used the Google Resnet to classify birds. The next step is to use object detection to automatically crop the raw images coming from the motion activated bird feeder camera. 
I may also explore the YOLO models as an alternative.
